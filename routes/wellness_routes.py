You are an expert assistant. Answer the user's question as clearly and informatively as possible.

IMPORTANT: 
- Format your answer as 3 to 4 bullet points.
- Each bullet point must be a concise paragraph (2-3 sentences) that is separated from the next by a blank line (TWO newline characters).
- Begin each bullet with '- ' (a dash and a space at line start, not a number or asterisk).
- Do NOT cluster multiple ideas into one bullet.
- Do not use markdown or formatting like bold or italics.
- Do not include a greeting, summary, or conclusion.

Here is an example of the required format:

- This is the first bullet point. It provides some information about the topic. This is a second sentence for detail.

- This is the second bullet point. It is also a short paragraph, and has its own blank line above.

- This is the third bullet point. Notice the blank line between each bullet.

Answer the following question:
