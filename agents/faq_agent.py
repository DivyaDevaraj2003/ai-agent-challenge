    # --- New 20 Questions ---

    # Process & Logistics
    "How long does it take to get my results?": "Once our lab receives your sample, it typically takes 3-4 weeks to process and generate your personalized report. You will be notified via email when your results are ready.",
    "What is inside the collection kit?": "The kit includes a saliva collection tube, a funnel, stabilization fluid, a biohazard bag for the sample, and a detailed instruction manual. A pre-paid return shipping envelope is also included.",
    "Can I eat or drink before collecting the saliva sample?": "To ensure sample quality, please do not eat, drink, smoke, or chew gum for at least 30 minutes before providing your saliva sample.",
    "What if my collection kit is lost or damaged?": "If your kit arrives damaged or is lost, please contact our customer support team immediately, and we will arrange for a replacement kit to be sent to you.",
    "How do I activate my kit?": "You must activate your kit online using the unique barcode number provided inside the box. This links your sample to your secure online account.",

    # Report & Results

    "Can my family members use my results?": "Your genetic report is unique to you. While you share DNA with family members, they would need to take their own test for accurate, personalized insights.",

    # Science & Technology
    "What technology is used for the genetic testing?": "We use state-of-the-art genotyping technology on a custom microarray chip, which analyzes hundreds of thousands of specific points in your genome with high accuracy.",
    "How accurate is the genetic test?": "Our laboratory testing process has an analytical accuracy of over 99%. The interpretation of the results is based on current, peer-reviewed scientific research.",
    "Does my DNA sample get stored?": "You can choose whether we store or discard your biological sample after it has been analyzed. You can manage your preferences from your account settings.",
    "What is the difference between genotyping and sequencing?": "Genotyping, which we use, looks at specific, well-studied points in your DNA. Whole-genome sequencing reads nearly all of your DNA. For wellness insights, genotyping is highly effective and more affordable.",

    # General & Policy
    "What is your refund policy?": "You can request a full refund before your sample collection kit has been shipped. Once shipped, refund policies may vary. Please refer to our Terms of Service for full details.",
    "Can I buy a test as a gift for someone?": "Yes, you can purchase a kit as a gift. The recipient will need to create their own account and register the kit's unique barcode themselves.",
    "Is there a minimum age to take the test?": "Yes, the person providing the sample must be at least 18 years of age.",
    "How can I delete my account and data?": "You have the right to close your account and have your personal data deleted at any time. You can initiate this process by contacting our customer support team.",

    "Who are your genetic counselors?": "Our team consists of board-certified genetic counselors with expertise in translating complex genetic information into practical and understandable health insights."
